Disqus has been one of the go-to commenting system for websites and blogs. It's one of the pioneers and probably still the biggest out there.

However, its popularity has faded for quite a while now due to people being unsatisfied with the direction Disqus is headed. It doesn't help too that there's increasing competition in its market. One unlikely competitor to it isn't actually other comment hosting services, but instead, it's social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit.

Comments on websites and blogs have lessened now because communities aren't there anymore. What usually happen these days is that your audience will share your content on platforms they're in and talk about it there. Thus, one popular alternative is to just simply disable comments and let it happen organically on other platforms. That way, you wouldn't have to worry about moderating your comments of toxicity and spam.

Now before you jump the bandwagon of disabling comments and leaving it up to other platforms. You should first realize the problems that comes with it. First, your website or blog may feel unhospitable as it doesn't encourage dialog. And second, it's harder to add value beyond your content.

If this leaves you on a dilemma on whether to look for a better alternative to Disqus or disabling comments entirely, then you should first try Cenchat.

## What's Cenchat?

Cenchat is an alternative to Disqus where it reinvents the comments section in your websites and blogs.

It's a chat-based solution where your audiences are only allowed to send private messages to you. You can then publicize those chats as **read-only** so the insightful ones can stand out. Now you can let the community conversations happen elsewhere and still leave your websites and blogs inviting for people that wants to get further insights from you.

Here are more features that complements the way Cenchat is designed:

### Anonymity

Cenchat allows anonymous accounts because chats can be made public without the user's consent. However, anonymity always goes hand-in-hand with online harassment. But due to how Cenchat is designed in that you can only send messages to the author and it's up to them if it's worthy to be published, harassment can then be kept at a minimum.

### Realtime

People have been spoiled with how fast and easy it is to chat in messenger apps. They should expect no less when doing it in comments section. As a chat-based solution, Cenchat has that for you.

### Data management

We value your privacy and we want to put you in control of your data. We allow everyone to delete their account on Cenchat.

When this happens, your chats will continue to exist but anonymized to keep the context of the discussion. Everything else on our servers that's identifiable to you will however be deleted.

*We currently don't support exporting your data but this is in our pipeline.*
