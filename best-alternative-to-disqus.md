## What's Cenchat?

Cenchat is an alternative to Disqus where it reinvents how we can have conversations with authors.

We're only allowed to send private messages to them so the public (and mostly toxic) conversations can happen elsewhere. Authors can then publicize those conversations as read-only so the insightful ones can stand out.

## What makes Cenchat the best alternative to Disqus?

Cenchat is the result of our goal to modernize and complement the discussions happening outside your websites/blogs (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, messenger apps, etc.).

At this moment, it would be safe to say that the current state of comments section is bad. It can be toxic pretty quickly and is hard to consistently moderate. Some websites and blogs even remove it completely and I donâ€™t blame them.

We believe that the following factors are the key to having successful engagement with your audiences moving forward:

### Direct messages

Most discussions have moved to other platforms like Facebook and Twitter. This usually happens when they share your content within their circle. This is actually great since the potential toxicity can happen elsewhere.

Cenchat complements this movement as it only allows us to send messages directly to the author. Thus, keeping an open channel where we can still talk with the source of the content itself.

### Private by default

Chats in Cenchat are private between you and the author by default. However, they may publicize it as read-only so the insightful ones can stand out. This can help deal with repetitive conversations like when people ask the same things.

### Anonymity

Cenchat allows anonymous accounts because chats can be made public without the user's consent. However, anonymity always goes hand-in-hand with online harassment. With how Cenchat is designed in that you can only send messages to the author and it's up to them if it's worthy to be published, harassment can then be kept at a minimum.

### Realtime

People have been spoiled with how fast and easy it is to chat in messenger apps. They should expect no less when doing it in comments section. As a chat based format, Cenchat has that for you.
