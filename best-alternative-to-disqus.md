Disqus has been one of the go-to commenting system for websites and blogs. It's one of the pioneers and probably still the biggest out there.

However, its popularity has faded for quite a while now due to people being [unsatisfied with the direction Disqus is headed](https://fatfrogmedia.com/delete-disqus-comments-wordpress/). It doesn't help too that there's [increasing competition in its market](https://nestify.io/blog/11-best-disqus-alternatives-you-should-try/). One unlikely competitor to it isn't actually other comment hosting services, but instead, it's social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit.

Comments on websites and blogs have lessened now because communities aren't there anymore. What usually happen these days is that your audience will share your content on platforms they're in and talk about it there. Thus, one popular alternative is to just simply disable comments and let it happen organically on other platforms. That way, you wouldn't have to worry about moderating your comments of toxicity and spam.

Now before you jump the bandwagon of disabling comments and leaving it up to other platforms. You should first realize the problems that comes with it. First, your website or blog may feel inhospitable as it doesn't encourage dialog. And second, it's harder to add value beyond your content.

If this leaves you on a dilemma on whether to look for a better alternative to Disqus or disabling comments entirely, then you should first try Cenchat.

## What's Cenchat?

Cenchat is an free alternative to Disqus where it reinvents the comments section in your websites and blogs.

It's a realtime chat-based solution where your audiences are only allowed to send private messages to you. You can then publicize those chats as **read-only** so the insightful ones can stand out. Now you can let the community conversations happen elsewhere and still leave your websites and blogs inviting for people that wants to get further insights from you.

## Why should I use Cenchat?

Here are a few reasons on why you should use Cenchat:

### No ads

Our business model doesn't revolve around tracking users and showing them ads. Instead, we plan to introduce a pricing model where we'll still offer a generous free tier.

Ultimately, our goal is to convert the big publishers into paying customers in order to sustain our business.

*Currently, everything is free without any limits. Paid plans will be introduced soon.*

### Faster

Cenchat is designed to be lazy loaded so it wouldn't be a bottleneck for your websites and blogs. It also only loads just the absolute necessary needed for your audience to start engaging with you.

Since Cenchat is a chat-based solution you can also expect the same speed and responsiveness you get with your favorite messaging apps. Hence, you can rest assured that Cenchat is also a faster alternative to Disqus.

### Better privacy

One of Cenchat's goal is also to be a better privacy alternative to Disqus.

We allow anonymous accounts because chats can be made public without the user's consent. However, anonymity always goes hand-in-hand with online harassment.

With how Cenchat is designed in which every chat is private by default, harassment can then be kept at a minimum.

### Data management

Not only do we value your privacy, we also value your data and want to put you in control of it. We allow everyone to delete their account on Cenchat.

When this happens, your chats will continue to exist but anonymized to keep the context of the discussion. Everything else on our servers that's identifiable to you will however be deleted.

*We currently don't support exporting your data but this is in our immediate pipeline.*
