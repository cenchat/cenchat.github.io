# Privacy Policy

*Effective date: April 21, 2019*

This policy explains what information we collect when you use Cenchat's sites and services. It also has information how we receive that information, and what we do with it once we have it.

## Information we collect and how we use it

There are two ways that we collection information from you.

**By you giving it to us directly**

This happens when you sign up and/or update your existing profile manually. Examples for this are your name and email which we and other Cenchat users use in order to communicate with you.

**By the actions you take while using Cenchat**

This includes actions such as what pages you access and your interactions with our product features (e.g. messages). This information includes records of those interactions, your Internet Protocol address, information about your device (such as device or browser type), and referral information.

## Information disclosure

We don't sell your information to third parties. However, we do share them in some instances, including:

- When we have asked and received your permission to share it.
- To a service provider or partner who meets our data protection standards.
- When the law requires it. We'll notify you when we're asked to hand over your personal information in this way unless we're legally prohibited from doing so. We'll object to requests that we believe are improper.
- When we have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of you and our other users.

## Data storage

Cenchat uses third-party vendors and hosting partners, such as Google, for hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology we need to run Cenchat.

## Third-party embeds

Some of the content that you see displayed on Cenchat is not hosted by us. One example is GIFs from Tenor. We don't control what data third parties collect in cases like this, or what they will do with it. So, third-party embeds on Cenchat are not covered by this privacy policy. They are covered by the privacy policy of the third-party service.

## Tracking & Cookies

We use browser cookies and similar technologies in various ways. One example is for automatically signing you in to Cenchat.

We may be able to track you across the Internet but this will only be done when websites you visit embeds our Cenchat Widget service. When that happens, we track only your interactions within the Cenchat Widget.

Some third-party services that we use to provide the Cenchat Service, such as Google Analytics, may place their own cookies in your browser. This Privacy Policy covers use of cookies by Cenchat only and not the use of cookies by third parties.

We comply with the “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) standard recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium only when you're signed-out to your Cenchat account. When you use Cenchat while signed-in to your account, we won't comply with DNT as it will help us provide and improve our products and services for you.

## Modifying or deleting your personal information

If you have a Cenchat account, you can access, modify or export your personal information, or delete your account in your account page.

When you delete your account, all your Cenchat messages will be kept but anonymized to keep the context of their discussions.

## Data security

We use encryption (HTTPS/TLS) to protect data transmitted to and from our site. However, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, so we can’t guarantee security. You use the Service at your own risk, and you’re responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account.

## Business transfers

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, reorganization or sale of assets such that your information would be transferred or become subject to a different privacy policy, we’ll notify you in advance so you can opt out of any such new policy by deleting your account before transfer.

## Changes to the policy

We may periodically update this Policy. We’ll notify you about significant changes to it. The most current version of the policy will always be here.
