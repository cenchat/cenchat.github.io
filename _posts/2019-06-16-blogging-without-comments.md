The fact that you're here means that you're probably contemplating of disabling comments on your blog. To give you a short answer, then yes, you should. However, you still need to have a way for your readers to directly contact you for feedbacks and opinions.

Neil Patel has a good [article](https://neilpatel.com/blog/blogging-without-comments/) on whether you should or shouldn't blog without comments. But I believe that these are the strong arguments that would make bloggers disable their comment section:

1. Most of the blogs out there have audiences that prefer to interact in social media.
2. On the odds that they don't, it's time consuming to moderate it. And leaving it alone would result in harassments and spam to be visible side-by-side with their content.

Social media has definitely taken over comments. People are already registered there, holding conversations and sharing stories. You can't really force your readers to share their comment wherever you want them to. In fact, a lot of [popular sites](https://www.niemanlab.org/2015/09/what-happened-after-7-news-sites-got-rid-of-reader-comments/) have already disabled their comment section in favor of social media. The problem now is can you be in every one of those networks? Where can they directly talk to you? In Twitter? What if they don't have a Twitter account?

There are a lot of platforms out there—like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc.—and it can be hard if not impossible to be in every one of it. But if people prefer to discuss things there, why stop them? You'll most likely fail if you try to. But you have to consider the scenario that if there's no way to directly contact you, the feedbacks and questions people have would be taken in by someone else. This prevents you from providing value beyond your content and worse, may lead to the spread of misinformation.

Jeff Atwood believes that *[a blog without comments is not a blog](https://blog.codinghorror.com/a-blog-without-comments-is-not-a-blog/)* and I agree with him. Except that I'd rather say it as *a blog without any way to engage is not a blog*.

Restricting things into a one-way dialogue isn't what blogging is all about. To me, blogging is about sharing your ideas, getting feedback, and finding out what your audiences want to read so you can write it for them. So in essence, blogging should be social and those socialization must happen in the form of a comment section or a feedback section.

## What can you do about it?

You don't need to build communities within your blog since they're already in social media. You just need to be part of it as much as you can so you can chime in and build connections with them.

What you can do is to have a way to where your readers can still send their feedbacks and opinions to you directly. Just like in a comment section, you can place this at the end of your article.

Again, you should avoid having something like: *Got feedback? Reach out to me on Twitter @myusername* as not everyone might be registered in that social network. Instead, you can do something simple like having a feedback form that they can use. Even simpler is to just ask them to send you an email if they want to get in touch.

However, if you're looking for a more full-blown solution, then you're already here. We've built Cenchat exactly for this.

### Cenchat solution

Cenchat is a realtime chat service where you can only send private messages to the blog author from within the article itself. The blog author can then publicize the conversation as read-only for other people. This way, the insightful chats can standout and may even serve as a new form of FAQ for the article.

## Wrapping up

Social media is now the new platform for blog comments. For most blogs out there, not having a comment section isn't a dealbreaker—it's having no form of engagement at all is what is.

Comments have evolved and your blog should too.
