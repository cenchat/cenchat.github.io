Disqus has been one of the pioneers of comment hosting service and is still the biggest one in terms of market share right now. But for how long?

Its popularity has faded for quite a while now due to people being [unsatisfied with the direction it's headed](https://fatfrogmedia.com/delete-disqus-comments-wordpress/). It doesn't help too that there's [increasing competition in its market](https://nestify.io/blog/11-best-disqus-alternatives-you-should-try/). One unlikely competitor to it isn't actually other comment hosting services, but instead, it's social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit.

A lot of [popular websites](https://www.niemanlab.org/2015/09/what-happened-after-7-news-sites-got-rid-of-reader-comments/) have completely disabled their comments with the goal of moving it to various social media platforms. This happens when people share their content on platforms they're already in and talk about it there. This makes it easier for the website owners as they don't have to moderate comments and it will also speed up their websites by a lot.

What's interesting is that even if comments are turned on, the same thing most usually still happens. Perhaps because people are just much more comfortable talking about things with people they know or communities they're apart of. That could be why they prefer sharing and talking about it with them rather than in an open podium like a blog's comment section.

But before you jump the bandwagon of disabling comments. You should first realize the problems that comes with it. First, your website or blog may feel inhospitable as it doesn't encourage dialog. And second, your audiences would have a more difficult time of directly engaging with you preventing you from providing value beyond your content.

If this leaves you on a dilemma on whether to look for a better alternative to Disqus or disabling comments entirely, then you should first try Cenchat.

## What's Cenchat?

Cenchat provides a better way to engage with the audiences of websites that have opted to disable or thinking of disabling their comments section.

It's a realtime chat-based solution where your audiences are only allowed to send private messages to you. You can then publicize those chats as **read-only** so the insightful ones can stand out. Now you can let the community conversations happen elsewhere and still keep an open channel for people that wants to get further insights directly from you.

Furthermore, here are a few reasons on why you should switch to Cenchat:

### No ads

Our business model doesn't revolve around tracking users and showing them ads. Instead, we plan to introduce a pricing model where we'll still offer a generous free tier.

Ultimately, our goal is to convert the big publishers into paying customers in order to sustain our business.

*Currently, everything is free without any limits. Paid plans will be introduced soon.*

### Faster

Cenchat is designed to be lazy loaded so it wouldn't be a bottleneck for your websites. It also only loads just the absolute necessary needed for your audience to start engaging with you.

Since Cenchat is a chat-based solution you can also expect the same speed and responsiveness you get with your favorite messaging apps. Hence, you can rest assured that Cenchat is also a faster alternative to Disqus.

### Better privacy

We take privacy seriously and we strive to be the better alternative to Disqus when it comes to it. When we get information about you, we take less. The only data we want is the data that will make Cenchat work for you.

Anonymous accounts are a big part of Cenchat because chats can be made public by the website owner without the user's consent. However, anonymity always goes hand-in-hand with online harassment.

With how Cenchat is designed in which every chat is private by default, harassment can then be kept at a minimum.

### Data management

Not only do we value your privacy, we also value your data and want to put you in control of it. We allow everyone to delete their account on Cenchat.

When this happens, your chats will continue to exist but anonymized to keep the context of the discussion. Everything else on our servers that's identifiable to you will however be deleted.

*We currently don't support exporting your data but this is in our immediate pipeline.*
