I'm a person that likes to read comments. It's one those things that I just instinctively look for after reading an article and I'm sure that I'm not the only one. These days though, whether in social media or blogs, I'm seeing less of the quality comments that I love to read. It's now mostly polluted by people being trolls, abusive, and witty. It comes to the point where I block some websites that I used to read stuff of from.

## Comments have moved to social media

[Popular websites](https://www.niemanlab.org/2015/09/what-happened-after-7-news-sites-got-rid-of-reader-comments/) have already disabled their WordPress comments completely in favor of moving the conversations to social media because of 2 reasons:

1. **Less moderation for bloggers**. It can be time consuming to moderate comments. Leaving it alone risks having the toxic ones to be associated to your article.
2. **Impact of social media**. For the majority, they would discover your articles in social media when their circle of friends shares it. Thus, it's more natural for them to continue the engagements there.

What's wrong with this though? Well, the downside here is that your community would be disconnected since there are a lot of social media platforms out there like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit—just to name a few. Not everyone is in each one of it and this makes it harder for you and your readers to engage with one another. More often than not, they would be missing out on the valuable insights you have with your comments.

## How the idea came up

So I thought to myself:

> How can I encourage people to comment in their favorite social media channels but still keep some of the things centralized and civilized?

Naturally, your blog would be the centralized location itself. But how, do I keep things civilized?

When a toxic comment is addressed to me, I can be sure to be professional in order to not escalate it further. However, I couldn't guarantee it for someone else. So I come to realize that most toxic comments that are hard to control happens when they're addressed to someone else or when they're just outright spam. And with these set of problems, I sought to build something for it.

## Modern alternative to the likes of Disqus

The goal of Cenchat is to provide a new form of engagement within your blog that complements social media. What it does is that it enables your readers to send private messages to you—the blogger. Those conversations can then be publicized as read-only for other people so the insightful ones can stand out.

With this, your readers can now have a way centralized way to contact you directly. You also now have an easier way to filter out those toxic conversations and your readers won't be missing out on your valuable comments unlike before where they're scattered all over various social media platforms.
